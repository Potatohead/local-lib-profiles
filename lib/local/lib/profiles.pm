=head1 NAME

local::lib::profiles - makes modules feel at home

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.02';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

describe the module, working code example

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

local::lib::profiles is designed to extend upon the methodologies of
lib::local to make it simpler to create, manage, and discard local perl
profiles.

=cut

=head1 COMMANDS

These are the cmd line usages for the package

=head2 ll_mkprofile

Creates a profile under the LOCAL_LIB_HOME directory by the given
name.

=head2 ll_rmprofile

Removes a profile that lives under the LOCAL_LIB_HOME directory 
by the given name.

=head2 ll_workon

Activates a previously created profile.

=head2 ll_deactivate

Deactivate the currently active profile. Note that this is only
available if an profile is active

=head2 ll_upgrade_profile

Replaces or create the Active scripts in a given local-lib profile.
This can be used to either turn a local-lib library into a full blown
profile or to take an existing profile and upgrade it to contain more
recent scripts

=head2 ll_cdprofile

Changes directory into the root of the profile

=head1 ROUTINES

=cut

=head2 make_profile

Creates a new local lib profile in the supplied directory

=cut

sub make_profile {
    my %args = validate(@_,
        {
            directory => {
                type => SCALAR
            }
        }
    );
    
    # create base local lib
    local::lib->ensure_dir_structure_for($args{directory});

    # then upgrade it to a local lib profile
    upgrade_profile(directory => $args{directory});

} # end of subroutine make_profile


=head2 find_activate_script

Finds the path of the activate.sh script

=cut

sub find_activate_script {
    my %args = validate(@_,
        {

        }
    );

    my @lib_paths = split /:/, $ENV{PERL5LIB};

    foreach (@lib_paths)
    {
        if (-e $_.'/local/lib/profiles/activate.sh')
        {
            return $_.'/local/lib/profiles/activate.sh';
        }
    }

    die "No activate.sh script found in library paths";
} # end of subroutine find_activate_script


=head2 upgrade_profile

Upgrades a local lib directory into a full profile

=cut

sub upgrade_profile {
    my %args = validate(@_,
        {
            directory => {
                type => SCALAR
            }
        }
    );

    my $activate_script = find_activate_script();

    File::Path::mkpath($args{directory} . '/bin');

    deploy_support_file(
        source => $activate_script,
        destination => $args{directory}.'/bin/ll_activate',
        profile_location => $args{directory}
    )

} # end of subroutine upgrade_profile



=head2 deploy_support_file

takes a support file from a given local (like lib/activate.sh or the templates
directory), substitutes the content tokens that it finds, then writes the file
to the required destination

=cut

sub deploy_support_file {
    my %args = validate(@_,
        {
            source => {
                type => SCALAR
            },
            destination => {
                type => SCALAR
            },
            profile_location => {
                type => SCALAR
            }
        }
    );

    # File::Util cannot handle // in its file paths, so gotta replace them

    $args{source} =~ s/\/\//\//g;
    $args{destination} =~ s/\/\//\//g;

    #open the source of the file
    my $file = File::Util->new();
    my $support_file = $file->load_file($args{source});

    #substitute the tokens
    $support_file =~ s/__PERL_PROFILE__/$args{profile_location}/g;

    #write to its destination
    $file->write_file(
        file => $args{destination},
        content => $support_file
    );

} # end of subroutine deploy_support_file
